## What is Open Code Review?

Open Code Review (**OCR** for short, distinct from Optical Character
Recognition) is an AI-powered code review CLI distributed as the
[`@alibaba-group/open-code-review`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alibaba-group/open-code-review)
NPM package and as standalone Go binaries. The CLI binary is named `ocr`.

In a single command (`ocr review`) it:

1. Resolves a Git diff — workspace, branch range, or single commit.
2. Filters the changed files using both system defaults and any user rules.
3. Spawns one **per-file sub-agent** for each changed file, in parallel.
4. Each sub-agent runs an LLM tool-use loop, optionally preceded by a
   **plan phase** for larger diffs.
5. The model calls `code_comment` to record findings, optionally `file_read`,
   `code_search`, `file_find`, `file_read_diff` to gather context, and
   `task_done` when finished.
6. OCR resolves each comment to exact line numbers, runs an optional
   re-positioning pass for any comments that didn't match cleanly, and
   prints (or JSON-emits) the final list.

## The problem with general-purpose agents

If you've used a general-purpose coding agent (Claude Code with a Skill,
Cursor, Cline, etc.) for code review, you've likely run into:

- **Incomplete coverage** — on larger changesets the agent quietly cuts
  corners, reviewing only some files.
- **Position drift** — comments don't line up with the code they refer to;
  line numbers and file paths drift off target.
- **Unstable quality** — natural-language Skills are hard to debug, and
  output quality fluctuates with minor prompt edits.

The root cause: a purely language-driven architecture lacks **hard
constraints** on the review process.

## Core design: deterministic engineering × agent

OCR's core philosophy is to combine **deterministic engineering** with an
**agent** — each handling what it does best.

### Deterministic engineering — hard constraints

For steps that *must not go wrong*, engineering logic — not the model —
guarantees correctness:

- **Precise file selection** — a [five-gate filter](../review-rules/#how-files-are-filtered)
  decides exactly which files are reviewed, with explicit `include`/`exclude`
  controls.
- **Smart file bundling** — related files (e.g., `message_en.properties` and
  `message_zh.properties`) can be grouped into a single review unit. Each
  bundle runs as a sub-agent with isolated context — divide and conquer that
  stays stable on very large changesets and naturally supports concurrent
  review.
- **Fine-grained rule matching** — review rules are matched per file path
  with first-match-wins, keeping the model's attention sharply focused and
  eliminating noise. Template-based matching is more stable than purely
  language-driven rule guidance.
- **External positioning and reflection modules** — independent comment
  positioning ([`internal/diff/relocation.go`](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/blob/main/internal/diff/relocation.go))
  and re-location passes systematically improve both location and content
  accuracy.

### Agent — dynamic decision-making

The agent's strengths are concentrated where they matter most:

- **Scenario-tuned prompts** — prompt templates deeply optimized for code
  review, improving effectiveness while reducing token consumption (see
  [`internal/config/template/task_template.json`](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review/blob/main/internal/config/template/task_template.json)).
- **Scenario-tuned toolset** — distilled from analysis of tool-call traces in
  large-scale production data (call-frequency distributions, per-tool
  repetition rates, the impact of each tool on the overall call chain). The
  result is a purpose-built set of [six tools](../tools/) that is more stable
  and predictable than a generic agent toolkit.
